/**
 * lipsync-frozen-contract.ts — FROZEN as of v400.
 *
 * Single source of truth for every tuning value in the lip-sync chain.
 *
 * Why this file exists: between v190 and v399 the same numbers lived inline in
 * a dozen modules. Every attempt to fix one symptom silently moved a threshold
 * somewhere else, and nobody could tell afterwards which combination had
 * actually worked. On 2026-08-03 the chain hit all four speakers correctly for
 * the first time since 27.07. — these are the exact values of that run.
 *
 * RULES
 *  - Do not change a value here without an explicit "unfreeze lipsync".
 *  - Changing a value breaks `lipsync-frozen-contract.test.ts` on purpose.
 *    That test failing is the signal, not an obstacle.
 *  - Modules must import from here instead of re-declaring literals.
 *
 * See `.lovable/LIPSYNC-FEATURE-FREEZE.md` and `docs/lipsync-pipeline-v400.md`.
